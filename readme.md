# jQuery Tweetify

## Purpose
A simple script that attaches to user defined elements to make them valid Tweet buttons, either using a custom generated (on the fly) href with a build in popup window script or by utilizing the default Twitter widgets.js file.

## History
I was working on a project where we had to handover code to a third party that unfortunately didn't really know what they were doing.

Out of this necessity I created Tweetify.
